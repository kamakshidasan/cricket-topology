# cricket-topology

This repository contains scripts and data that was used for the work:  [Spatial Comparison of Cricketers](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01852138/document/).

- If you are a cricket enthusiast: This repository has all the scripts to retrieve and parse cricket pitchmaps from ball trajectories for any match. 
- If you are a topology enthusiast:  Head [here](https://github.com/kamakshidasan/irrelevant/tree/master/scripts). I showcase the scripts that I use run batch processes in TTK.

Note that some of the scripts may use ArcGIS for interpolation.
