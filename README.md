# cricket-topology

This repository contains scripts and data that was used for the work:  [Spatial Comparison of Cricketers](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01852138/document/).

- If you are a cricket enthusiast: This repository has all the scripts to retrieve and parse cricket pitchmaps from ball trajectories for any match. 
- If you are a topology enthusiast:  Head [here](https://github.com/kamakshidasan/irrelevant/tree/master/scripts). I showcase the scripts that I use to run batch processes in TTK.

Note that some of the scripts may use ArcGIS for interpolation.

If you find this repository useful, spread the love by citing the above work :)
